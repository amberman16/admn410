	<h2>Our History:</h1>
	<p>Durham House of Pets is Durhams very own, local pet store company. We have been around 
	for over 50 years and was founded by John Lincoln in 1968. In the old days, we sold only 
	sold products for dogs. We used to train them in-house as well. Along with dog products, 
	we also sold products for cats. In the back of the store, we used to have a grand aquarium, 
	where kids would visit for hours after school. Over the years, we have grown much larger. 
	We have expanded our products for over 50 different types of pets, specifically dogs, cats,
	and snakes to name a few. We have also created our own brand of dog food and have been distributing
	them to different wholesale clubs such as Walmart and Target. 
	</p>
	<h2>Why use us?</h2>
	<p>We are a family-run business whose core values are integrity and providing the best service 
	and products to the local community. We sell nothing but the best quality and have a money back 
	guarantee. We have been around for over 50 years and is a trusted name. DHP is not only found 
	around your backyard, but our products can be found at your nearest wholesale club as well.
